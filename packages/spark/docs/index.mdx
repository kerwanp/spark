Spark is a light-weight and framework agnostic server-side [JSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_XML) runtime.

- 🚀 No build step required
- ⚡ Supports Async components
- ⏳ Streaming rendering
- ⛏ [Unpoly](/docs/unpoly) and [AdonisJS](/docs/adonis) integration

```tsx
async function UsersList() {
  const users = await User.all()

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <Users />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Comparisons

### React

Even tho React is now used on the server with [Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) it is a client-first JSX runtime made for building highly interactive Single Page Applications.

Spark on the other hand is a server-only JSX runtime that can be used with client-side libraries to provide reactivity.
With Spark, your frontend is entirely generated by your server and you do not need to build an entire API for your client.

If you are looking to build highly interactive applications I would not recommend switching to Spark.

### EdgeJS

[EdgeJS](https://edgejs.dev/) is a template engine for Node.js similar to [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) or [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) but with advanced features.

As Edge is an entirely custom templating engine it cannot benefit from Typescript types system and the tooling for IDEs is not complete
making the developer experience complicated.

If you are using EdgeJS, I highly advise you to give Spark a try.

### mono-jsx

[mono-jsx](https://github.com/ije/mono-jsx) is a light-weight JSX runtime that renders `<html>` element to a `Response` object.

Spark is a simplified, non-opinionated and extensible version of mono-jsx. mono-jsx have native support for building SPA and bring reactive primitives.
Spark does not bring any client-side features, it is up to the user to use libraries like [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), [Unpoly](https://unpoly.com/) to bring interactivity to their applications.

If you are using mono-jsx, Spark + [Unpoly](/docs/unpoly) is a great replacement.

## Philosophy

### KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple)

Spark tries to be as simple as possible by only providing the basic requirements for rendering HTML on the server using JSX.

It is up to you, as a user or library author, to decide how you want to use it: generating simple static websites, building Hypermedia applications or creating the next Terminal UI framework.

### Agnostic

Even tho Spark has been originally made for the [AdonisJS Framework](https://adonisjs.com/) it has been built with the
goal of being fully framework agnostic while still providing all the necessary APIs to build
powerful integrations for your favorite tools.

For example there is an [Unpoly](/docs/unpoly) integration that implement the [Server Protocol](https://unpoly.com/up.protocol) for optimized responses and conditional requests.

### Customizable

While Spark itself is light-weight and bring only basic requirements for rendering HTML with JSX, it provides APIs for extending its capabilities.

You can for example add custom renderers to modify the rendering pipeline and create powerful tools.
