## Installation

Install the package using the following command :

```package-install
yarn add @sparkjs/spark
```

Inside your `tsconfig.json`, allow usage of "jsx" and specify the `jsxImportSource` to use Spark as your JSX runtime:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compileOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "@sparkjs/spark"
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

Later you will learn the full capabilities of Spark. For the moment lets render a simple html page with the most simple JSX.

```tsx tab="Typescript"
const App = () => {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello Spark users!</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}

const html = await renderToString(<App />)
```

```html tab="html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello Spark users!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

<Callout>
  `renderToString` can be used to render to string. You can also use `renderToReadableStream` to
  stream content.
