## Introduction

The [@adonisjs/vite](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/basics/vite) package allows you to bundle the frontend assets of your application.
The Spark Adonis Integration provide a `Vite` component for including entrypoints in your application.

**Before continuing, make sure you have installed and configured [@adonisjs/vite](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/basics/vite).**

### Getting Started

The `Vite` component accepts a list of entrypoint paths and will render the `script` and `link` tags.
The paths you provide should match exactly the path registered inside the `vite.config.js` file.

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    adonisjs({
      entrypoints: ['resources/js/app.ts', 'resources/css/app.css'],
    }),
  ],
})
```

```tsx
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <Vite entrypoints={['resources/js/app.ts', 'resources/css/app.css']} />
      </head>
    </html>
  )
}
```
